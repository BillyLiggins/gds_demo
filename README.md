# Data Scientist technical exercise
## Billy Liggins

### Overview
This repository contains all the code writting in preparation for the Data
Scientist technical exercise. This included all analysis code, a local python
module "gds" and a heroku configuration to deploy a proof of concept web app.

### Initial setup

I run this under a venv, I would advice you do the same. To prepare install the
requirements with `pip install -r requirements`.

To run the streamlit app locally, you will need to supply a https://openweathermap.org/ api key ( free tire will do ).

### Generating plots
All plots can be generated by running the analysis scripts.

To run the scripts once in your venv, execute the scripts as follows ( the order is not important ):

```
python analysis_scripts/explore_data.py
python analysis_scripts/accidents_over_time.py
python analysis_scripts/check_possion_in_time.py
python analysis_scripts/lighting_correlation.py <- This script takes option -r to regenerate data cached after first running, running without -r is fast.
python analysis_scripts/make_model.py
```

### Running streamlit locally

This is where you need your https://openweathermap.org/ api key.

To run server execute the following which your venv is active:

`export OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY="{your_api_key}";pip install . ; streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
